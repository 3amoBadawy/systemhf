---

## üîß Configuration Files Handoff

### 1. **PHPStan Configuration** (`phpstan.neon`)
```bash
# Run PHPStan analysis
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse

# Expected result: 0 errors ‚úÖ
```

### 2. **Psalm Configuration** (`psalm.xml`)
```bash
# Run Psalm analysis
./vendor/bin/psalm --no-progress

# Expected result: ~178 errors (manageable baseline)
```

### 3. **PHPMD Configuration** (`phpmd.xml`)
```bash
# Run PHPMD analysis
./vendor/bin/phpmd app text phpmd.xml

# Expected result: ~148 issues (manageable baseline)
```

---

## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/quality.yml`)
- **Automated Quality Checks**: Runs on every push/PR
- **Tools**: PHPStan, Psalm, PHPMD, Deptrac, Pint, PHPUnit
- **Quality Gates**: Enforces quality standards automatically

### Running Quality Checks Locally
```bash
# Run all quality tools
composer quality

# Or run individually:
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse
./vendor/bin/psalm --no-progress
./vendor/bin/phpmd app text phpmd.xml
```

---

## üìã Daily Development Workflow

### 1. **Before Committing Code**
```bash
# Run PHPStan to ensure no new errors
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse

# Run Psalm to check type safety
./vendor/bin/psalm --no-progress

# Run PHPMD to check code quality
./vendor/bin/phpmd app text phpmd.xml
```

### 2. **Quality Standards to Maintain**
- **PHPStan**: Must remain at 0 errors
- **Psalm**: Keep errors under 200 (current: 178)
- **PHPMD**: Keep issues under 200 (current: 148)

### 3. **Code Review Checklist**
- [ ] PHPStan passes (0 errors)
- [ ] Psalm errors don't increase significantly
- [ ] PHPMD issues don't increase significantly
- [ ] Repository pattern used for data access
- [ ] Type annotations added where missing
- [ ] Laravel best practices followed

---

## üîç Troubleshooting Common Issues

### PHPStan Errors
```bash
# If new errors appear:
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse

# Check if it's a Laravel Eloquent issue
# Add to ignore patterns in phpstan.neon if needed
```

### Psalm Errors
```bash
# If new errors appear:
./vendor/bin/psalm --no-progress

# Check if it's a Laravel magic method issue
# Add to issue handlers in psalm.xml if needed
```

### PHPMD Issues
```bash
# If new issues appear:
./vendor/bin/phpmd app text phpmd.xml

# Address code complexity or best practice violations
```
